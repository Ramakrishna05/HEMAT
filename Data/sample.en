therefore , the application was made before the lower court to summoned these witnesses for the cross examination .
therefore , it is necessary to summon these witnesses in the interest of justice .
therefore , by believing the statements of these witnesses the accused should be punished .
so , on the basis of these fact the balance of convenience is also in favor of the defendant .
therefore , considering the facts , criminal Appeal of imprisonment to the accused - 185 / 08 penalties do not seem fair to be punished , but he brushed the pledge over ordinary matter .
so , the accused does not get any benefit from these facts .
therefore , describing these three as a criminal , due to arrest , the laws of Hasab has been taken into custody .
so , if any of these three searches the case then , the same thing can be brought out that they are all eyewitnesses .
so , there is no significance in the evidence of these documents .
therefore , on the basis of these documents it concludes that all the documents of the Jeep at the stated date , time and place were valid and effective .
therefore , it is clear from these documents that all the documents of the vehicle in question were valid at the time and place , the driving licence is also valid , the insurance was also valid and the vehicle was operating in accordance with the terms of policy and permit .
therefore , it is also an accepted fact between these two that they are living separately from March of 2004 whereas petition under section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act , dated 25-03-04 and petition under section 9 dated 28-04-04 are presented .
therefore , the presence of these two witnesses on the spot cannot be considered suspicious .
therefore , both of these witnesses PW-1 and PW-2 's statements that their girl was unconscious , was not in a condition to give a statement cannot be trusted .
therefore , it is clear from the statements of these two witnesses that the deceased drank poison ( nuvan ) himself due to anger and when the accused came to know about it , he screamed and called the neighbors for help and then he fell unconscious , who denies that some of his intention was to induce the deceased to commit suicide .
hence , the prosecution statement does not prove the evidence of these two injured witnesses .
therefore , both the petitioner jointly presenting the present petition along with joint affidavit 6C on date 19-03-2010 has requested the court to issue a decree of marriage separation .
therefore , from the evidence presented by the present principals of the two schools the date of birth of the missing person prove to be 16-06-1992 .
therefore , the oath of testimony of these two witnesses appears to be reliable in all the facts and circumstances of this matter , and the charged against the accused Chandrapal proves beyond doubt from the evidence of these two eyewitnesses .
therefore , there is no reason to reject the evidence of these two witnesses .
therefore , evidence of these two witnesses is not found unnatural or unreliable in any situation .
therefore , the statement of these two witnesses cannot be trusted .
so , the evidence of these two is not reliable .
therefore , there is no charge against the appellant / accused from the testimony of these two witnesses .
therefore , the order to issue notice for giving false evidence of Section 344 ( 1 ) of the Penal Code against these two witnesses / prosecutors is passed .
so , the evidence of these two witnesses is reliable .
therefore , to both of them it is advisable to give petitioner rs.5000 as compensation .
therefore , it will be justified to put together these two debates together .
therefore , both these issues are being settled together .
therefore , it is appropriate and relevant to be judge both these debate at one time .
therefore , both of these debates are being sorted out together .
therefore , in these sections also the accused is proved to be charged related to the allegation against him .
therefore , in these situations the statement of the prosecution for the alleged jurisdiction sanctioned by accused Sovat Singh in is doubtful .
therefore , in these circumstances , the statement of the petitioner does not prove that his wife Mrs , Sarita slapped him when he stopped her from eating tobacco because of this they were not in a physical relationship from date 07-06-03 while Mrs. Sarita has given clear evidence that she had relation with him and get pregnant in August month .
therefore , in these situations , it is lawful to give rs 50000 to petioner no.-3 mrs . Rukma Devi alias Rukmani Devi , rs . 40000 to petitioner no.-4 Lal Singh and rs . 100000 ( One Lakh rupees ) to prtitioner no.-2 miss Mahek Visht .
therefore , in these circumstances , witness Sheeshpal Singh Nehi PW-7 can not be called an fair witness and even if the public 's unbias person gets an oppurtunity to witness , the prosecution does not present such person as witness and as the consequence of not disclosing any reason for not presenting , the prosecution statement is questionable .
therefore , considering these circumstances , this monitoring court seems necessary to intervene in the inquiry order .
therefore , keeping these conditions in mind , the statement given by the injured ( deceased ) regarding the incident , he cannot be trusted beyond doubt .
therefore , keeping these circumstances in mind , in my opinion , there is no reasonable basis for the release of this juvenile delinquent on bail .
therefore , keeping in view these circumstances , it would be reasonable that
therefore , in these circumstances , the statement of the accused is not acceptable that the deceased was burnt with fire .
therefore , in these circumstances the accused does not get any advantage , just by telling the time of the arrest of the accused 7.30 by the criminal prosecution .
therefore , in these circumstances , there is no obligation to pay compensation to the insurance company .
therefore , in these circumstances , the statement of the accused is not acceptable that the deceased committed suicide by burning himself .
so , even in these circumstances the alleged jurisdictional sanction is doubtful .
so , even in these circumstances the statement of demand and torture of alleged dowry done by the defendant is not found to be acceptable .
therefore , in these circumstances it may also presumed that if the petitioner testifies to such a person in the evidence , then he did not support the statements of the petitioner which resulted in cruelty .
so , in these circumstances , it is possible that the common person does not see the injury of the body .
therefore , it is clear in these circumstances that the incident narrated by the witness mrs Raji Devi , PW-2 and the evidence of the juridical sanction given by mrs . Raji Devi , no such incident occured nor did any such jurisdictional sanctioned by Jaspal Singh .
therefore , in these circumstances the argument of the petitioner is not acceptable that on date 22-08-2004 the defendant had committed cruelty to him .
therefore , in these circumstances only the plaintiff 's statement is proved .
therefore , in these circumstances , the applicant must pay the maintenance allowance of Rs 2000 / - monthly to the opponent .
therefore , in these circumstances , the missing person did not have chance to take his birth certificate with him at that time .
therefore , in these circumstances , his evidence is not readable in this case .
therefore , in these circumstances , the responsibility of paying compensation is found in opponent number 2 Oriental Insurance Company and the petition is acceptable against it .
therefore , in these circumstances , the compensation application is acceptable against the opponent no . 1 Om Prakash Pandey for one sided .
therefore , in these circumstances the compensation application is acceptable against the opponent number 2 Reliance General Insurance Company Limited
therefore , in these circumstances , the compensation application is acceptable against the opponent no . -3 IFFCO Tokio General Insurance Company and opponent no . 4 United India Insurance Company Limited
therefore , in these circumstances , the court has no other option except believing the age of deceased 35 years according to the oral evidence of the petitioner Maya Devi .
therefore , in these circumstances , after the death of Shri Ramdev Punetha , his place would be substitute by his daughter-in-law Shrimati Suman Punetha .
therefore , these panchnamas also have 5 minutes differences .
therefore , this statement of the plaintiff proves from these presented evidence that late Pyare Lal Kothari in exchange for the service of the trust in the room he
therefore , after investigating against the fake work done by these people , an order pass for the investigation of the death of his son Virendra . * *
therefore keeping these legal circumstances in view , I cannot find any strength in this appeal , and also it is worth remarkable that in this appeal the instruction has already been given to both the sides to maintain the status regarding the disputed property .
* * *
therefore , keeping all these fact in mind , I consider giving coefficient of 15 years as justified in every way .
therefore , on the basis of evidence of all these witnesses , the prosecution is not successful in proving and certified the murder against the accused Balram Nath and the accusation of eradication of evidence used in the murder .
therefore , in all these items it would be justified to give the additional amount of Rs . 5000 / - as compensation to the petitioner .
therefore , in all these circumstances , it is not proved that the accused had illegally placed brownsugar on 19.12.2007 in his cognizable possession .
therefore , in all these circumstances , there is no justification found for the deceased being missing from the in-law 's house without any reason .
therefore , in view of these entire circumstances , from the date of submission of the present petition 26-11-07 till date of actual payment
therefore , no adverse effects of the statement of these witnesses on the reliability and authenticity of the prosecution witnesses statement .
therefore , the statement of the prosecution does not prove from these evidences of the witnesses that Avatar Singh was beaten causing death by the accused . * *
therefore , there is no reason found to give false statements against the accused Sanju by these witnesses .
therefore , the argument of the accused in clarification of these evidence is not found to be acceptable that till date 22-03-07 's 12.30 O 'clock the accused name was not in detail .
therefore , the disclosure of these witnesses cannot be concluded that the deceased was seen last time alive along with the accused Kirpal Singh .
therefore , these evidence does not prove the prosecution 's statement that the ration and utensils kept in the cottage were burned to ashes .
also from these evidences on the property in question , the plaintiff is proven to be the owner of the trust .
therefore , this fact also proven from these evidences that Bishan Singh died at Srinagar Base hospital during treatment .
therefore , adverse evidence of these witnesses is not on the document .
therefore , as a result of these evidences alleged judicial sanction is found to be suspicious .
therefore , these evidences does not prove the prosecution statements that the alleged dowry was sought by the accused .
therefore , it is also clear from these evidence that the defendant did not give up the petitioner but because of the petitioner 's mistreat , the defendant is bound to stay in his maternal home .
so , there can not be another trial again on these grounds .
hence , giving them benefits of the Probation Act they should be abandon .
therefore , the burden for proving them was on the petitioner and the presented records do not fall under the category of public records .
therefore , according to the tribunal , it is advisable to give simple interest of 6 % from the date of submission to the date of payment of the petion to the petioner .
therefore , for the cancellation of the merits and demerits of this appeal the delay in the appeal is forgiven and the appeal is accepted .
therefore , there is no reasonable basis for interference in question in any way by this Appellate Court .
therefore , on the basis of this record , Vinod 's injuries cannot be proven .
so even on this basis , prosecution - approval can not be considered illegal .
so even on this basis , the statements of these two witnesses are not believable .
therefore , on this basis , the statement of PW-2 that he saw his son tied with a rope did not seem right .
therefore , on this basis , the annual income of the deceased is fixed at 60 , 000 / - .
therefore , on this basis , the age of the deceased is identified to be of 10 years .
therefore , on this basis , the notional income of the deceased is fixed at Rs . 36,000 / - per annum .
therefore , on this basis , the notional income of the deceased is fixed at Rs . 36,000 / - per annum .
therefore , on this basis , the opponent number 1 , the insurance company 's statement has no force that the vehicle in question was moving against the terms of the insurance policy and motor vehicle act on the date of the incident .
therefore , on this basis , the opponent number 2 , the insurance company 's statement has no force that the vehicle in question was not operational with valid forms and valid driving licence on the date of the incident .
therefore , on this basis , the opponent number 2 , the insurance company 's statement has no force that the vehicle in inquiry was not operated with valid forms on the date of incident .
therefore , on this basis , the opponent number 3 , the insurance company 's statement has no force that the vehicle in the query was not operational with valid forms and valid driving licence on the date of the incident .
therefore , on this basis , the opponent number 3 , there is no force in the argument of the insurance company that , the vehicle at the time of the incident was not operational with valid forms and valid driving certificate .
therefore , on this basis , the opponent number 5 , the insurance company 's statement has no force that the vehicle in the query was not operational with valid forms and valid driving licence on the date of the incident .
therefore , on this basis pay certificate cannot be read in evidence and neither it is proved nor any basic payroll was introduced .
therefore , on this basis there is no force .
therefore , 40 , 15 , 000 c40 / 100 = 6 , 000 / - of this income is annual .
therefore , 40 , 28 , 800 c40 / 100 = 11 , 520 / -of this income is annual .
therefore , 40 , 36 , 000 c40 / 100 = 14 , 400 / - of this income is annual .
so there is no fraud on the basis of this agreement .
therefore , it does not seem necessary to hear the non applicants in this MJC case .
therefore it is fair to get the amount of compensation of Rs . 50 , 000 / - in this medicine item
therefore , it can not be assumed that it was meant for bribe only .
therefore , there is no importance of this in the evidence .
therefore its statement and paper are very important .
therefore , due to this , it is justified to give a sum of about 25 - 26 thousand rupees to the petitioner and if all the amounts are calculated , it is almost close to one lakh rupees .
therefore , it is proved that the opponent No. 4 , the insurance company is responsible for paying the amount of compensation .
therefore , its benefit cannot be obtained by the defendant number-1 .
so it is confirmed accordingly .
therefore , due to its non-availability , it can be presumed that during the accident , the truck driver did not have valid and effective driving license .
therefore , it is clear from its statement that the drug was seized on the spot by the accused .
therefore , it is not necessary to mention the full details of its statement .
therefore , it is clear from its interpretation that after the order to take action from SDHM Lohaghat , the witness himself took the alleged report to himself .
therefore , specific evidence is required for this .
therefore , he can not be held guilty for this .
therefore , the facts of this case are different from the facts of the presented case .
therefore , the readiness and interpretation in this case is certified in the evidence .
therefore , there is no justification for believing in this cash memo paper number 33 c / 1 .
therefore , the 11 statement of this witness is also not reliable and the so-called charged list has also been asked to be made on the saying of the High Commissioner .
so , in relation to the alleged production of the witness , when goods are not seen , then it is not reliable and the original recovery was not made on the spot .
therefore , the above statements of this witness are also suspicious and unbelievable because the interpretation of the other witnesses and this witness is totally contradictory .
therefore , the affidavit of this witness can not be read in evidence .
therefore , the evidence of this witness is also important .
therefore , evidence of this witness is not enough to verify the demand of bribe .
therefore , the evidence of this witness does not come to the conclusion that opium poppy farming was done by the accused Roseanne on time .
therefore , according to this witness , around 50 gram of sample goods and remaining illegal weeds were sealed in yellow cloth and in pink colored polythene .
therefore , it is clear from the statement of the witness that the witness is just telling the grapevine .
therefore , according to the above statement of this witness ,
therefore , from the statement of the witness , the statement of the alleged bus being run fast by appellant / accused is not reliable .
therefore , from the statement of the witness , even the story 14 of the alleged memo being sent is not reliable .
therefore , from the statement of this witness , the authenticity of the alleged CT scan report is also doubtful and unreliable .
so , from the said proclamation of this witness , when his wife and girl were brought to the government hospital , Lohaghat , on the second day of the incident , it is not possible to register the report at 8 : 30 o 'clock in Patwari office , Janakande .
so the Reliability of the so-called incident ends with the said affair of this witness .
therefore , it is clear from the statement of the witness also that during the alleged interrogation , Laxmidutt Pant , by which the accused was charged and the plaintiff , who was the Secretary of the Committee , were also present .
therefore , it is also clear from the above statement of this witness that if the police personnel asked any person about his name and address etc and the person did not tell his name and address , it is extremely unbelievable .
therefore , from the statement of this witness , if it is assumed that the injured person went to Om hospital on date 2-4-17 , then in that condition , date : 1 - 4 - 2007 , ie on the date of the incident , the injured was not taken for treatment at Om Hospital nor he was admitted .
therefore , it is also clear from the above statement of this witness that it is also doubtful that the alleged recovered goods can be signed on the sealed cloth of the surveillance , etc. and there is no signature on it .
therefore , it is clear from the above statement of this witness that the family of the accused and plaintiffs live in the same colony and they know each other family for 7 years but they did not visit each other family .
therefore , it is clear from the above statement of this witness that Khatima had this witness and his brother only in the hospital , not his parents .
therefore , it is clear from the said verse of this witness that through people 's telling the witness is telling that Shyamlal Verma broke the teeth of the perplexed Ganeshram by stoning stones .
therefore , from the statement of this witness , the statement of the plaintiffs and his son Shri Jagdish Singh that the story of the bloody shirt gave to Patwari and he sealed it , is not reliable .
therefore , from the statement of this witness , the statement of Shri Lalit Mohan Bhatt is confirmed that after two months when he went to the spot people told that the accident was caused by canter 's driver mistake .
therefore , according to the above statements of this witness it is clear that the report of the alleged incident has been written
therefore , according to the statement of the witness , the plaintiffs have been asked to go to the house of Bahadur Singh from Mohan Singh 's house .
hence , the confirmation of this statement is necessary with the testimony of other witnesses .
therefore , the statement of this witness can not be considered reliable too .
so , there is no reason to disbelieve on this witness statement .
therefore , from the statement of this witness , the prosecution cannot be given any advantage in proving the allegations against the accused
therefore , from the statement of the witness , it is not proved and certified the case of the threat of arson and kill , against the accused Ramesh Chandra .
so , even with this witness statement the prosecution does not get any benefit in proving the allegations against the accused .
so , even with this witness statement the prosecution didn 't get any benefit in proving the allegations against the accused .
therefore , from the statement of the witness , there is no evidence against the accused .
therefore , it is also reflected in the statement of this witness that his mother had not even seen the accident whereas the deceased mother Shakuntala Devi has witnessed in favor of the petitioner .
therefore , it is clear from the statement of this witness 7 that 11-11 : 30 the plantiff has been informed by the security guard .
therefore , from the statement of the witness , it is confirmed the accused drank alcohol and it is clear that the accused drank and had beaten the deceased and also he sold the deceased 's mobile .
therefore , it is also evident from the testimony of this witness that the alleged quarrel had happened among the women and no one has seen the quarrel again by this witness .
so from the point of view of this witness the said statements during the main examination are completely unreliable
so from the statement of this witness the alleged statements during the main examination are completely unreliable .
therefore , it is clear from the statement of this witness that the alleged statement by the deceased in connection with her husband Prakash Bhatt or any others is not clear .
therefore , from the statement the witness , the story and the events told by the prosecution are confirmed .
therefore , on the basis of evidence of this witness , the accused are not entitled to receive any benefits .
" therefore , there is a contradiction in the statement of this witness , because this witness has accepted on page 2 during his main examination that " there was a fight between the two at night before the incident .
therefore , this witness was not able to tell the deceased that immediately after throwing the bottle of Nuvan he drank poison .
therefore , this witness has elaborated in his statement .
therefore , this witness has also elaborated in his staetement and on this basis the statement of this witness is not believable .
therefore , this witness has mistakenly said that on the day of the incident , he had seen in the hands of Ratan Nishad and then seen in the court , but at this point he has forgotten the fact that he had seen it even during the recovery .
therefore , there is no adverse effect on this fact on the case of prosecution .
therefore , the possibility of this fact can not be ruled out that due to this rivalry , the plaintiff has been sued on the accused Bhajan Singh .
so there is no special difference from this fact .
so , there is a lot of contradiction in the prosecution evidence in this way .
therefore , it is not important to have such contradictions .
therefore , it is established in such a way that wherever he lives he will be in settlement , but he did not talk to anyone about this .
so there is no force in this argument too .
therefore , the record paper no . 21A cannot be considered FIR in any way under Code of Criminal Procedure section 154 ( 1 ) .
therefore , according to this Tahri report representative A-1 , the FIR has been prepared by the police and only it will be considered as the FIR .
therefore , due to this accident , his life has been spoiled .
therefore , in this accident , the questionnaire has been shown wrongly indulging to get the claim from the motorcycle .
hence , from this point of view , the petitioner institute Institute of Management Studies has no objection for holding a loan in lieu of receiving a loan in this land / property Oriental Bank of Commerce , Dehradun .
hence , from this point of view , the petitioner institute Institute of Management Studies has no objection for holding a loan in lieu of receiving a loan in this land / property Yes Bank Limited , Dehradun .
hence , from this point of view , the petitioner institute Northern Institute of Management Studies has no objection for holding a loan in lieu of receiving a loan in this land / property Kurmanchal City Cooperative Bank Limited , Saharanpur Road , Dehradun .
hence , for the demand of this money , the alleged petition has been presented by the petitioner .
therefore , the final obligation to pay this money belongs to the insurance company .
therefore , no benefit of this present can be given to the clarification side .
therefore , the refinement of this surveillance is being done on the basis of merit and demerit .
hence , there is no reasonable basis for interference in the inquiry order by this monitoring court .
hence , there is no power in this surveillance and it is worth to be canceled .
hence , there is no power in this surveillance and it is worth to be parted .
therefore , in addition to this Court , apart from reducing the accused from the accused offense , no other option is reflected , therefore the accused is the officer to be free from the accused crime .
therefore , this court has no jurisdiction to hear the current debate .
therefore , this court has not got the jurisdiction to hear the proceedings .
therefore , this court has the jurisdiction to hear the proceedings .
therefore , this court will make the same concept that mrs . Neera has been assassinated by the accused for dowry .
therefore there is no basis for any kind of interference in the conclusions given by the lower court in relation to the issue number 9 of this court .
therefore , exhibit A-2 was put on it .
therefore , exhibit A-3 was put on it .
therefore , exhibit A-5 was put on it .
therefore , in this situation , if the court does not create additional issue related to jurisdiction , then the rights of the defendant will be adversely affected , which it says to be received .
therefore , it is natural for the accused to have prejudice even without the statement of the research officer in this case .
therefore , in this case , the decision of the remaining accused except Indra Prajapat is to be decided .
therefore , whatever compensation amount which will come in this case will be paid by the The New India Insurance Company Limited .
therefore , the right to shed water in this type of drain does not arise .
therefore , whatever compensation amount will be received in this compensation petition will be paid by the insurance company .
therefore ,
therefore , the amount of this fixed deposit are not entitled to receive by the petitioner .
therefore , nothing has been mentioned about the incident by this witness that the Rausal police chowki or Pancheshwar police station comes before his village , why didn 't they report the incident there ?
therefore , there is no difference in the nature of the research the investigator used the government money as the tap amount .
so , there is no difference that the bribe money has not been recovered from Khajan Singh .
so , there is no clarification about the incident that why the statements of these witnesses should not be believed .
therefore , this affirmation has also been done in the seizure list by the plaintiffs case that the accused was informed by the provisions of Section 50 of the NDPS Act .
therefore , the possibility of this cannot be denied that while coming back after drinking alcohol , he might be fallen in the drain by the river side and got injured .
therefore , the possibility of this fact cannot be denied that the first information report might been lodged after consultation advice , but it is clear that Tahrir Exhibit A-1 has been written by the PW-1 through speaking .
therefore , no acquiescence is required on this point .
therefore , at this point there is no force in this argument of the defense advocate that whether their challan were made under the Electricity Act or not .
therefore , at this point , the acquiescence given by the learned of the lower court is contradictory to law and is not considered worthy .
so , there is no need to consider this point in detail that is there any reasonable reason for the petitioner to remain separate and the fault of which side .
therefore , there is no such fact in the statement of the witness on this point in which his statement could disbelief .
therefore , in this case , the petitioner can be considered deserving for getting lump sum of Rs.1,00,000 for further treatment .
therefore , in this case too , to give an amount of Rs . 10,000 as subsidiary to the petitioner seems justiciable .
therefore , in this case too , to give an amount of Rs . 10,000 as subsidiary to the petitioner seems justiciable .
therefore , in this case , I considered it is worth to give Rs . 5000 / - ( five thousand )

therefore , in the circumstances of this case , there is no force in the argument of the accused 's lawyer that the FIR has been delayed and the accused is entitled to the benefit of suspicion .
so the facts of this matter are different from the facts of the present case .
therefore , it would be appropriate to use the coefficient of 11 in this case .
therefore it would be appropriate to use the coefficient of 13 in this case .
therefore , in this case , the coefficient of 14 is determined .
therefore , in this case , the coefficient of ' 15 ' is determined .
therefore it would be appropriate to use the coefficient of 15 in this case .
therefore , in this case , the coefficient of ' 18 ' is determined .
therefore , in this case , the recovery from the petitioner cannot be done .
therefore , in this case , the recovery from the petitioner cannot be done because Khalsa Public School is currently closed .
therefore , in this case , keeping in mind the age of the deceased mention above , the coefficient of 15 is determined .
therefore , in this case , keeping in mind the age of the deceased mention above , the coefficient of 17 is determined .
therefore , in this case , the coefficient of 18 is determined on 16 years the age of the deceased .

therefore , in this case at the age of the deceased is 23 the coefficient of ' 18 ' is determined .
therefore , in this case at the age of the deceased is 35 the coefficient of ' 16 ' is determined .
therefore , in this case , from the total annual income of the deceased , Rs 1,26,000 , 1 / 3 part of it i.e. Rs 42,000 assuming to spend on himself , deducting this amount the remaining amount of Rs 84,000 is fixed as the annual income of the deceased .

therefore , in this case , the petitioner no.- 4 mrs . Shakila , the deceased Shakir Hussain 's mother cannot be considered dependent on the deceased Shakir Hussain .
therefore , in this case , the responsibility of paying 75 percent of the total amount of the compensation is insured by the insurance company opponent No. 5 and the remaining 25 percent of the money is payable by the car owner / car insurance company to the petitioner .
therefore , in this case , whatever compensation amount will come , the payment will be done by the opponent no.-3 National Insurance Company Limited .
hence , there is no reason whereby this witness should not be considered .
therefore , from the purpose of this petition , the age of the deceased is fixed at approximately 43 years at the time of the accident .
therefore , it would be appropriate to give this amount , because it is a common experience that all medicines in the government hospital are not available for free .
therefore , this amount is also considered to be 25000 / - instead of 35280 /
therefore , this debate is required .
therefore , the burden of proving the point of this argument is on the petitioner .
therefore , there is no defect in not making a party of necessary clients in this case .
therefore , this disability certificate is not being taken into account .
therefore , no benefit of this law system can be given to the accused .
therefore , the event is suspicious as a result of this delay .
therefore , in the enlightenment of this analysis , the debate point no . 2 is decided accordingly .
therefore , this misfortune cannot be considered as important .
so , in this regard there is a great difference in the statements of these two witnesses .
therefore , it was necessary to have the medical report in this regard that the plaintiff had been fed intoxicant or poisonous substance .
therefore , in this regard the petitioner Anita doesn 't come saying something .
therefore , in this regard , the lower court has not correctly interpreted the Code of Criminal Procedure section 197 .
so , please take legal action in this regard .
therefore , in this regard , there is no force in this argument of the learned advocate of the defense .
therefore , in this regard , the petitioner has the right to receive an amount of Rs . 10,000 .
therefore , in this regard , the petitioner has the right to receive an amount of Rs . 2,000 separately .
therefore , the opposition 's objection is rejected in this regard .
therefore , in this regard , the decree of the civil death declaration should be passed by the court .
therefore , the statement made on this point of the witness appears to be true .
therefore , there is no such statement of the witness that he has seen throwing the stone to an accused .
therefore , the statement of this witness is not worth to believe .
therefore , the statement of this witness about the fact of the accident is not important .
hence , the statement of this witness is fully trustworthy .
therefore , filing of goods in the goods godown of the witness becomes suspicious to the statement that he did not receive any receipt for filing the goods .
therefore , the main examination and counter-examination of this witness are not more important in this case .
therefore , according to this witness , he had previously seen the deceased alive and after sometime he had seen him in injured condition .
therefore , according to this witness , when the marriage procession started from the Kyari village at that time the witness also saw him .
therefore , according to this witness also , thec deceased was only seen for the last time in the Kyari village .
therefore , there is also contradiction in this statement of this witness .
therefore , the above statement of this witness does not seems to be in force .
therefore , from the statement of this witness , there is no allegation against the accused Chandan Prakash alias Fajitu .
therefore , by the statement of the witness , the prosecution 's statement is denied .
therefore , from the statement of the witness , there is no allegation against Ujala Devi regarding involvement in the incident or the incident caused .
therefore , the First Information Report becomes more suspicious to this witness statement and from the sworn statement of this witness the prosecution story does notget any support or force .
therefore , the manner described by the statement of this witness does not prove the accident and does not confirm the accident was done by the vehicle driver in question .
therefore , the statement of this witness has prove that Bhagat Singh has serious deadly injured on his body .
therefore , the statement of this witness does not get any strength in the prosecution case .
therefore , from the statement of this witness it is proved that the deceased slip from the roof falling on a sharp object getting injured and died .
therefore , it is displayed from the statement of the witness that the laundry place where it is said to have laundry is very far from the road and if the vehicle hit the deceased that far , then the handpump and other items would have also broken .
therefore , it is proved by the statement of this witness that he has come to give a statement from the need to get a compensation in the lawsuit .
therefore , it is proved from the statement of this witness that he had seen the deceased Harikishan alive for the last time in the evening 6 : 30 while going home and the accused was also present at that time and there was wooden stick on his hand .
therefore , it is clear from the statement of this witness that this is not the witness of the incident and it has been made a witness later .
therefore , it is clear from the statement of this witness that the death of the deceased was due to the cause of himself , and at the time of the death of the deceased , his marriage was more than seven years old .
therefore , evidence of this witness does not prove the prosecution statement of seeing the deceased with the accused Bhagwan Singh for last time .
therefore , the evidence of this witness proves the statement of the petitioner .
therefore , this witness cannot be considered eyewitness of this incident , but this witness had written the FIR in the police station according to the story he heard and also given the witness in the court .
therefore , the deceased Harikeshan was seen alive at evening 6 : 30 as told by the witness and has proved the accused was there standing with wooden stick .
so , this witness had not seen the accident .
therefore , this witness had told that Sanju Lal , Trepan Singh and another boy were present on the spot at the time of the incident .
therefore , it is not justiciable to believe in this witness .
therefore , according to this witness , it will not be lawful and justiciable to punish the accused .
therefore , it is also clear from this witness that the evidence of the panchayat given the petitioner and his witness was actaul a panchayat .
therefore , it is not establish from the witness that the incident was not happened .
therefore , it is clear from this evidence that the police party was only in Delhi for the whole time on date 21 .
therefore , it is interfered in condemnation to this limit and appeal is partially acceptable .
hence , the adverse proposition will be against the accused only .
hence , there was no justification for giving an application / petition to the police before this .
therefore , this also raises suspicion on the story of the prosecution .
therefore , it proves that there was a distrust and criminal conspiracy between the accused .
therefore , the right to ask for the declaration of this related rights is by the Revenue court .
therefore , it is clear that the accused had the information that the quarrel side will come in this way and they had fought in a well-planned manner because of their previous fight .
therefore , the accused is found guilty in this regard .
therefore , in this regard , this witness had developed in his statement and its statement cannot be considered reliable .
therefore , in this regard , there is a contradiction in the statement of the witness about the petition and Riyaz Ahmad 's statement was also not mentioned on that day .
therefore , in this regard , the statement of PW-1 cannot be considered reliable .
therefore , in this regard , there is no need to elaborate in detail .
therefore , at this level , this possibility cannot be denied that the petitioner has submitted the original receipt to the department for payment .
therefore , at this level , it cannot be filed .
therefore , it is not justified to appoint a receiver for managing the temple 's custody at this level .
therefore , in this situation , the provisions of Section 306 of Indian Penal Code also attract .
therefore , there is no strength in the appeal of the accused / appellant and it is worth to reject the appeal of the accused / appellant .
therefore , there is strength in the appeal of the accused / appellant and the appeal of the accused / appellant is acceptable .
therefore , in this situation , the fact has not been confirmed that the accused Swaran Singh demanded a bribe money from complainant Ramaram .
therefore , it should be set aside .
therefore , it should be punished with this harsh punishment .
therefore , it cannot be denied .
so there is no justification for not being considered .
therefore , it should be repealed .
therefore , keeping this in persistence the above-mentioned points are settled .
therefore , the said amount of Rs 29,000 is not worthy to get by the petitioner .
therefore , the accused was presented before the court for duly taking action .
therefore , it is recommended to seize the bail of Suresh Chand Sharma son of Mehilal Sharma .
therefore , the injury shown in the report is one year before the accident .
therefore , the responsibility to comply with the said order was that of the then Executive Officer , who was Totaram at that time and he is not the accused in this case .
therefore , the said order should be confirmed .
therefore , the above order dated 7.1.06 is the last and again the opposition cannot raise this point .
therefore , on the said basis the argument of the appellant 's lawyer advocate is unfounded .
therefore , on the said basis the argument of the appellant 's lawyer advocate is pointless that the property in question is of the appellant .
therefore , the argument of the accused / appellant 's advocate on this said basis is not valid that according to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure , section 197 , no person can be cognizant against the public servant without permission .
therefore , the argument of the accused / appellant 's advocate on this said basis is pointless .
therefore , the mention argument of the accused / appellant 's advocate on the said basis is pointless that there is no blockage on the goods .
therefore , the prosecution 's case also ends on the said basis , and the observer cannot even find such a conclusion that why the deceased drank poison and the chargesheet given by the observer is also a result of a mis-interpretation .
therefore , on the said basis , the annual income of the deceased will be justified adding the co-effecient of 17 to Rs 14,000 .
therefore , it is worth to acquitted from the said charge .
therefore , the principles laid down in the quotation do not apply in this lawsuit .
therefore , it will be equitable to made the above presumption against the police .
therefore , the application 54 A could not be accepted because of the aforesaid reasons .
therefore , the method provided in the said case does not provide any benefit to the provisions of the case presented .
therefore , in the said cases , the law system which are related to FIR , does not provide any benefit to accused of the case
therefore , the said driving licence is not valid , but it is forged and fake .
therefore , after frisking robe of said Jaiprakash in front of the gazetted Officer / Majistrate and asked , then he said that I trust you and I have no objection .
therefore , the above fact also makes the case of prosecution suspicious .
therefore , keeping in view the above facts , it is fair to leave the accused on probation of one year - not punishing imprisonment in charge of the IPC section 504 , 506 .
therefore , keeping the above facts in view , the decision of the two sessions is being passed simultaneously .
therefore , on the basis of the said facts , the petition against the respondent no . 1 is eligible to be abrogated .
therefore , the petition in the vision of the said facts is deserved to be dismissed .
therefore , the said document exhibit D-2 is related to this case , this fact does not seem completely beyond doubt .
therefore , the accused does not get any benefit from the said document exhibit D - 2 .
therefore , the applicant does not get any benefit from the said document exhibit D - 2 .
therefore , whatever has been claimed in the said complaint , it has the legal right to take those money .
therefore , in both the statement of the said witness there is also a contradiction in relation to the place of recovered goods .
therefore , it is clear from the statements of both the witnesses that the accused were on motorcycles and the police party was on foot .
therefore , both the above cases have been requested to be transferred to any tribunal .
therefore , the said amount of money should also be reduced from the total amount of compensation fixed .
therefore , the petitioner does not deserve to get the mentioned amount .
therefore , the said fact of Nazir are not applicable to the facts of the present case .
therefore , the said notice given to the complainant by the defendant regarding the said notice dated 17 / 3 / 04 is unconstitutional and against the law .

therefore , in the above situation , the roadways corporation 's staff will be justified to be considered in the periphery of the government servant .
therefore , in the said case , who is the real owner of the property in question , whose valid real possession is , this fact will be decided by the following court after detailed evidence .
therefore , on the basis of the said principle as well The petitioner number 3 and 4 are not authorized to receive any compensation money .
therefore , the said defendant was adequately qualified but they did not claim any rejoinder .
therefore , the said photograph taken the intoxicant state is not shown by the statement of this witness .
therefore , in the said case , it has been requested to be given ten Lakh compensation .
therefore , in the said case , the applicant is entitled to receive additional amount of Rs 2500 / - .
therefore , in the said case , it will not be appropriate to give harm the petitioner
therefore , his knowledge is certified illegal on the above mentioned intoxicant .
therefore , the appeal has been accepted in the said case .
therefore , the respondent has no liability to pay any compensation for the opponent .
therefore , this argument has been presented for recovery of the said amount .
therefore , on reducing the said amount the compensation amount is Rs . 1,50,000 / - .
therefore , on reducing the said amount the compensation amount is Rs . 3,84,000 / - .
therefore , on reducing the said amount the compensation amount is Rs . 4,32,000 / - .
therefore , on reducing the said amount the compensation amount is Rs . 5,04,000 / - .
therefore , on reducing the said amount the compensation amount is Rs . 7,20,000 / - .
therefore , the said amount has been obtained from the complainant Omprakash in the form of recovering fine , this defense is also not correct .
therefore , legal action should be taken against the aforesaid people by lodging a report .
therefore , legal action should be taken against the aforesaid people by lodging a report .
therefore , on the basis of the mention testament , the applicant Indrajit Singh , who is his father , is his legal successor .

therefore , the conclusion is based on the above explanation that the plaintiffs have been fully successful in certifying and proving his case , so the permission of the following intention is granted by accepting the dispute .
therefore , the conclusion is based on the above explanation that the prosecution is completely unsuccessful in proving beyond reasonable doubt against the acccused charged under IPC section - 380 , hence the accused charged under IPC section -380 is declared absolved .
therefore , it is clear from the above explanation that all the elements required to constitute the crime of Section 138 are lawful in the case and have been certified by the complainant .
therefore , the said consent cannot be considered in continuation of the notice .
therefore , there is no reason to mistrust in the statements of the witnesses .
therefore , from the statement of the said witness and the FIR , firstly comes to this conclusion that cylinder has stolen from the house of the petitioner on the date of the incident .
therefore , it is reflected by the perception of the above evidence that
therefore , if the coefficient of 16 is used on the said annual income total income of the compensation is Rs 24000 16C Rs 3,84,000 .
therefore , considering the above situation , the matter is at the initial stage .

therefore , in the above situation , force appears in monitoring and the monitoring is acceptable , and the vehicle is released under supervision under certain circumstances .
therefore , in the above situation , the proceeding of the lawsuit has been forwarded unilateral on dated 17.5.10 against the opponent .
therefore , keeping in view of all the circumstances and financial condition of the clients in the said situation , I consider it appropriate to give the petitioner a monthly maintenance allowance of Rs 10 , 000 / - from the opponent .
therefore , appropriate legal action should be taken .
so , please take appropriate action .
so , try to get fair justice .
therefore , the respondent 's liability is not to pay compensation .
therefore , no one was present from the respondent side also .
therefore , the respondent is not responsible for the payment of the opponent compensation .
therefore , an order is required to give compensation of Rs 2,00,000 from the appellant - accused by the respondent-plaintiff .
therefore , the respondent / opposition Smt . Tulsi Devi , whose letter has been separated due to continuous absent and absconding of the respondent No. 1 Satish Chandra Kharakwal , should be punished with harsh punishment .
therefore , the respondent has no liability to pay any compensation for the opponent .
therefore , the respondent is free to oppose petition against all points under section 170 of the opposition Motor Vehicles Act , which the owner of the vehicle receives .
therefore , a temporary injunction should be passed to the settlement of the dispute against the legal notice - 3 , responder no . - 1 .
therefore , the order of prosecution unilateral execution has been passed on date 3-3-2009 against the defendant / respondent number 2 by the court .

therefore , there is no possibility to have any inconvenience or inadequate damage on them .
therefore , no amount has been determined to them .
so , those people went in and saw some notes were there printed on five hundred rupees and some were printed on paper and the notes on some papers were printed incomplete .
therefore , there is no need for all those people to be made a party , against which no harassment is sought by the accused , even if the interests of these persons are contained in the land of Gauri Singh .
therefore , they should be punished with minimum punishment .

therefore , the above FSL report does not have any significance in the situation and it can not be assumed that this report is a report of drug seized from the accused .
so , in such a situation , it has been more than 6 months that the accused is in custody .
therefore , in such situation where confiscation has been reported to be in public place , Section 42 ( 2 ) of the Act is not suitable .
therefore , in such a situation , the prosecution has succeeded in proving Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code against the accused .
therefore , in this case , the prosecution has succeeded in proving Section 302 , 394 , 411 of the IPC and the court finds the accused guilty of the charges under Section 302 , 394 , 411 of the IPC accordingly .

so in such a situation , the prosecution did not prove that the prosecutor 's age was less than 16 years on the date of the incident .
so in such a situation , prosecution evidence will be subtle analysis .
the case of the prosecution seems doubtful from evidence recorded , therefore , it is concluded after the above explanations that the prosecution has failed in proving the charges against the accused under Section 39 of Indian Electricity Act over suspicion of doubt .
therefore , in such a situation , there is a proper basis for the release of the goods in his favour .
therefore , in such a situation , a seven-year-old girl who had been six or six and a half years at the time of the incident , told Ramesh Chandra that the person who had come to drink water in his tap during the day is the same person who came to their house at night . this implies that Pooja had seen the accused Mohan Singh doing the alleged incident .

therefore , I consider the monthly income of the deceased to be fixed at Rs 3,000 on the basis of daily wages justifiable due to lack of evidence .
how was the report prepared at 17 : 45 in this situation ?
therefore , in such a situation , it is not justifiable to be given monthly maintenance under Section 125 to the petitioner .
therefore , in such a situation , as a Hindu married wife of the opponent , she has the legal and moral right to receive the money to incur dispute with her husband / opponent .
therefore , in the various decisions passed by the Honorable High Court of Uttarakhand , Nainital where the income is not proven , the nominal income marking is fixed at Rs 36,000 per annum in such a situation .
therefore , in this case , the law parable of Honorable High Court Uttarakhand , Shobhan Singh vs New India Assurance Company , 2007
therefore , the monthly income of the deceased should be justifiable to consider Rs 2500 per month and Rs 30,000 per year in such situation .
therefore , the annual income of the deceased is estimated Rs 36,000 on the basis of national income in such a situation .
therefore , the annual income of the deceased is estimated Rs 36,000 on the basis of national income in such a situation .

hence the condition is worth abolishing .
so be punished at least .

therefore , in the absence of any income proof , the nominal earning Rs 15,000 rupees of the deceased can be taken for cognizance and one-third of this income if the deceased lives , then spend on it .
therefore , the offense against any accused is not proved and both Mafatlal and Ram Singh are to be acquitted by all the charges imposed on them .
so , they do not have the right to receive compensation any kind .
therefore , there is a contradiction between the statements of two witnesses in relation to sitting of Mamta in the car , and the statement of Mamta which was registered under Section 164 of IPC which was exhibited on the letter number 2 , was accepted by Mamta , Dipin said that let 's drop you home .
therefore , the total compensation amount is Rs 1,50,000 + 2,000 + 5,000 = 1,57,000 / - rupees
therefore , the total compensation amount 17,60,000 + 2,000 + 5,000 = 17,67,000 / - seventeen lakh sixty-seven thousand such petitions is accepted annually .
therefore the total compensation amount comes to Rupees 17,61,619 , 2,000 , 5,000 = 17,68,619 / - ( seventeen lakh sixty-eight thousand six hundred and nineteen thousand rupees ) .
therefore the total compensation amount is 3,12,000 , 2,000 , 5,000 = 3,19,000 / - three lakh nineteen thousand rupees .
therefore the total compensation amount is 4,86,000 , 2000 , 5000 = 4,93,000 / - .
therefore the total compensation amount 5,61,600 , 2,000 , 5,000 = 5,68,600 / - five lakh sixty-eight thousand six hundred rupees .
therefore , the total compensation amount is 6,67,760 , 2,000 , 5,000 = 6,74,760 / - and six lakh seventy-four thousand seven hundred sixty rupees .
therefore the total compensation amount is 6,75,000 , 2000 , 5000 = 6,82,000 / - ( six lakh eighty-two thousand rupees ) .

therefore , this application paper has been presented with the aim of creating pressure .
therefore , in the facts and circumstances of the case , the provisions of Section 504 of IPC are not attracted .
therefore , there is a contrary precedence against the canter driver that it was his speed and negligence in the accident .

therefore , if the amount of claim compensation , interest is payable , then the insurance company will pay the opponent number 3 to its counterpart .
therefore , to claim compensation funds , there is no official right to receive any interest .
therefore , the petitioner number 2 , 3 and 4 are entitled to receive 90 percent and petitioner number 1 to receive 10 percent of the amount from the compensation amount .
therefore , the obligation to pay the indemnity has also been appealed for interest on the amount of indemnity on behalf of opposition number-2 , insurance-22 .

therefore , for determining the compensation , the monthly income of the deceased is assumed to be Rs 18,000 .
therefore , Rs 14,00,000 / - should be given for compensation .
so the Khafifa court has the jurisdiction to listen to it .
therefore , it deserves to be dismissed .
therefore , it deserves to be dismissed .
therefore , on the basis of the monthly income of Rs 3000 , Ganesh Chandra Uniyal 's annual income is fixed at Rs 36,000 .
therefore , evidence of witness Arjun Singh is also important .
so the witness 's statement does not seem reliable .
so this statement of the witness appears misleading .
therefore , the above-mentioned statements of the witnesses also make the story of the alleged marriage unbelievable .
therefore , evidence of the witness Nathuram also becomes important in this case .
hence the statement of witness PW-3 Chandrasekhar proves that the witness PW-3 Chandrasekhar , who is a resident of Lohaghat , knew the accused Devram earlier .
therefore , there is no basis for the re-calling of the witness Rampal and the request letter was canceled with this conclusion .
so the evidence by the witness PW 5 Hem Singh is important in this case .
so the witness took the accused to the Kundeshwari police station in the car .
therefore , the witnesses should be summoned .
therefore , the witnesses Durga Singh , Gokul Chandra Joshi and Pritam Singh should be called for re-examination , whose expenditure they are ready to bear .

so there was no possibility of any injury in the genitals .
so , the missing report was filed in the State 1997 ( 35 ) A.C.C. 880 ( Honorable Lucknow Bench ) but the benefit of this case cannot be obtained by the accused as 669 judicial sanctions were found to be suspicious in the case of Nazir Kavita versus Tamil Nadu State 1999 .
therefore , there is no relation to the proving testament from any amount received from the gas claim court .
hence , on the basis of the house in the village , the petitioner 's request for the release of the house situated in Ranikhet city cannot be cancelled .
hence , the petitioner is entitled to receive Rs 5000 for the serious injury .
therefore , the motive of the incident is proved and the judicial sanction made by the accused from the proven facts is also conclusive .
therefore , it is not right to be told the time of the incident around 8 : 30 PM in the facts and circumstances and it is reflected in this fact that being an eyewitness of the plaintiff , PW-1 Abdul Khalid comes to the periphery of suspicion .
therefore , please check the incident to register the case and issue Revenue to Police Station Khormola .

therefore , there is a serious contradiction in the statements of the First Information Report and the PW-1 in the date of the incident .
therefore , the presence of PW-6 at the time of the incident is not proven .
so there was sufficient light on the spot that the accused could easily identify PW1 and PW2 .
therefore , the reason for the presence at the place of incident is antithetical .
therefore , the story of bringing the injured from the spot is not reliable from the testimony of both because if the injured was brought at 12 O 'clock then he would have been taken to the doctor due to critical condition on the same day .
therefore , it is not proven and certified in any way by the evidence of the injured that the accused had beaten and abused him and also threatened to kill him on 31 / 5 / 2007 at 5 pm at the Bagwali Pokhara market .
hence , Chandpal was also authorized to drive the above mentioned Max pickup lightweight vehicle and had a valid and effective driving license .
so the expenditure of Rs 14,600 is proved in Chamba Hospital .
therefore , it is not right to keep the accused for an infinite time even after four years .
therefore , the four accused deserves to be proven guilty .
therefore , there is no responsibility for the driver rather the accident occurred due to the Act of God .
hence the insurance company has the responsibility of up to two lakhs in respect of the driver .
so the statement of the doctor is contradictory to the statement of the prosecution and the statement of the doctor reflects the fact that the death of the deceased was inherently natural .
therefore , the statement of the doctor and the statement of the witness of Jagdish Chandra Colony that the injured were admitted to the hospital , is also not reliable .
therefore , it is not proved by the doctor 's evidence that injury by the injured was made by itself .
therefore , the statement of Dr Patel has not been contradicted in counter-examination .
so the doctor has not confirmed any sperm after the slide test .
therefore , keeping in view the lack of medical certificate and keeping the statements of the applicant , it is not certified that the applicant suffered a crippling permanent disability , on the other hand , it was proved that it was normal injuries .
since the prosecution has counted the property acquired by him in 1973 therefore he has given details of his salary before 1975 .
therefore , since these documents were valid on the date of the accident , both of these resolutions are fixed against the opponent insurance company number 2 .
so the story of the treatment of the injured or clinical trial is not credible either by the above two testimony .
the reliability of the story of the injured being taken to Om Hospital becomes completely doubtful .
therefore , the said truth of the injured Bal Govinda about the alleged incident becomes suspicious .
so there are contradictions in prosecution evidence about the injuries .

therefore , it is appropriate that the files should be sent to the lower court for re-hearing .

therefore , it would be fair to give the complainant the opportunity to present the evidence .
therefore , it would be reasonable to send the case back to the lower court for the rehearing .
therefore , it would be appropriate to determine a lump sum amount in view of the circumstances of the case .
so this is a formal witness .
thus , this becomes a forged document .
so this witness asks Mamta to come to her mother 's house 10-11 times .
so the witness asks his mother to go to Khatima while his brother does not say to his mother to go to Khatima .
so the witness says to be married a year ago on the basis of the contract .
therefore , the witness has failed to explain anything about the alleged assault during the cross-examination and also accepts the conspiracy of the accused with him which also makes it clear that this witness is an eyewitness .
therefore , the witness refuses to the recovery of the alleged goods from the accused .
so this witness only tells women 's fight .
so this witness is public and social .
therefore , the witness tells the identification of the accused before Delhi Police .
so the witness has also been completely unsuccessful in proving the story of alleged assault and this witness refuses the involvement of any woman .
therefore , the witness was stating giving Rs 25,000 in 2004 and Rs 25,000 in November 2007 in his main exams , and the money is said to be arranged here and there .
so the witness states the hearsay in his trial .
therefore , the witness himself is making contradictory statements in the cross-examination contrary to the statements made during his main examination where his statement that Rs 25,000 was given twice , is not credible .
therefore , this fact is otherwise certified in the absence of evidence that the vehicle UP 70A U 9280 was insured by the opponent number 2 Reliance General Insurance Company on the date and time of the accident , and the vehicle was being operated according to the terms of insurance .
therefore , the fact is proven that Mohammad Salim has died .

so this fact will be considered acceptable .
so this argument is not worth consideration .
therefore , this argument is not acceptable that check provided was for the business purpose and complaint is not sustainable under the NI Act 138 .
therefore , these three persons are not witnesses in front of whom the accused has been influenced the deceased to eat the poison ( Nuwan ) .
so it is shown that Hari Singh has also died .
therefore , this foreclosure monitoring is not acceptable .
hence both of these points are decided accordingly .
hence both the episodes have been requested to be transferred to a single court .
hence both of these resolutions are decided against the opponents in light of the above review .
therefore , it can neither be said that the order passed by the lower court outside the jurisdiction nor can be considered as the order passed under re-evaluation .
therefore , it cannot be said that the accident occurred due to the speed , negligence Maruti van driver .
therefore , it cannot be assumed that the accused have committed a crime like murder due to the rivalry .

hence it cannot be said that the driver did not have the license at the time of the alleged accident .
therefore , it cannot be said that whatever money collected by the claimants is illegal .
therefore , it cannot be said that Ram Singh has not deliberately referred to the state government 's order to take advantage of criminal conspiracy of the accused .

therefore , this surveillance deserves to be canceled .
therefore , this surveillance is weak and deserves to be dismissed .
therefore , this surveillance is not conducive to being self-evident and is to be canceled .
this surveillance is not acceptable , according to which the surveillance is abrogated .
so this surveillance is acceptable .

therefore , it is fully proven that the motor cycle engulfed in the accident was legally insured from the insurance company on the date of accident .

so this application letter was given .
therefore , it was necessary to present this application sheet .
therefore , it is clear from the fact that only after receiving the audit report , the audit fee was to be paid by FDA Land Conservation by Lansdowne i.e. Plaintiff .

therefore , it is also not proved that the disputed petition number is a part of 345 and 346 .
so it is also clear that the balance of convenience is not in favor of the defendant at the present time .
this is only an accident and thus the charge of Section 304 IPC against accused Mrs. Dashi Devi is not proved and the accused Mrs. Dashi Devi is eligible to be acquitted from the charge of Section 304 of the IPC , so the following pass is passed .
so this is the only Recovery Chart and there is no acknowledged signature on this and neither there is any receipt .
so it was assumed that the prosecution story is completely unnatural .
so it was assumed that there is no independent endorsement of the evidence of the five witnesses and the accused were acquitted .
therefore it will be assumed that the accused voluntarily accepted this money .

therefore , the opposition Insurance Company is not responsible to pay the amount of compensation .
therefore , the argument of scholar advocate of the opposition Insurance Company was heard and had studied the forms and the available oral or archival evidence .
therefore , this statement of the opposition no.1 and 3 does not prove that accident in question was caused due to any mechanical failure of vehicle whereas no reason on the available file has been found to disbelief on the given adjuration letter evidence by the eyewitness Jaispal Singh P.W.-2.
therefore , this statement of the opposition no.1 and 3 does not prove that accident in question was caused due to any mechanical failure of vehicle rather in the light of present evidences of petitioner , this fact completely proves that Shrimati Lakshmi Devi did not have a natural death rather her death was due to an injury in the accident in question and this accident in question was caused by recklessness and inattentiveness in driving the vehicle by the driver . as a result of which , issue of point no.1 has been found to be proven , whose decantation in a affirmitive way has done in favour of petitioner .

therefore , The opposition no.2 The New India Insurance Company Limited and the opposition no.1 Rajesh Kumar Goswami , the vehicle owner is being guided that accordingly he pay the compensation of original amount and interest in front of tribunal through account payee cheque in 30 days from the date of passage of this award .
therefore , the opposition no.2 Insurance Company is unable to prove it that there is a result of collusion in between petition vehicle owner and the petitioner .
therefore , in this matter there is no liability of the opposition no.3.

therefore , the excusatory procrastination has been submitted , but no medical certificates or verification letter has been presented with application form , said in argument , that he was getting his home remedies .

therefore , the statement of judicator does not seem reliable .
therefore , it is evident by this statement of judicator that the judicator has not gone to the spot and all the proceedings have been done at the police station , whereby the charged allegation is not completely proved against the accused and on behalf of the accused , the public prosecutor Sankar Dutta Joshi D.W.-1 , Hukum Singh D.W.-2 and Navinram D.W.-3 has been tested in the evidence and by the 11 - 11 : 30 pm , the police jeep is standing near the Kalachan Tharah and there is a black motorcycle on it and the people in it have been asked to run away from the road in the bushes and the accused was told to stand by the police there , whereby the recovery of the Charas from the accused is not reliable for the prosecution and the accused should be discharged .
therefore , the permission from the District Magistrate is against the law and is contaminated before the submission of a allegation against the accused by the said statement of the judicator , because both the permission letter no - 4A / 7 and 4A / 8 given by the District Magistrate is of date : 14-11-2006 and typed in the same letter , in which there is no difference and that was typed by the judicator and no weapon and explosive material was sent for the perusal District Magistrate .
therefore , the story of identifying the accused by the driver Shakeel Hussain in front of the Delhi Police becomes unreliable by the said statement of the Judicator
therefore , it is evident from the said statement of the judicator that it has been asked to take permission from the District Magistrate , Champawat for running a suit against the illegitimate pistols and Kochi cartridges recovered from the accused Padam Singh Parki .
therefore , it is evident from the said statement of the judicator that those persons who have been asked by the judicator identify the accused by the pamphlet , none of them have mentioned in the presented case regarding the identification , and nor has conducted any identification parade by any witness , and nor did any witness make a witness in the charge sheet as witness , whereby the said statement of the judicator is completely suspicious and unreliable .
therefore , the story of prosecution to not attempt the testimony from the public witness by the judicator is proven suspicious .
the vehicle number M.H.04B-6925 is incorrectly written on the chargesheet paper number 22C / 4 .
therefore , the presence of Kri . Priya becomes suspicious from the said statement of the judicator and Rajnish Rana and by the witness Jeet Singh Pradhaan , PW-10 has been accepted during his cross-questioning that I did not get to know that any wrongdoing done with Priya was done by Maheshram or tried to do .
therefore , even the work of deliberation was commenced two month earlier .
therefore , during the discussion , the growth of section 4 / 25 A.A. Act will be done against the accused Gyan Chandra .
therefore , when the discretion officer says this in his statement that in deliberation , this fact was not clear that why deceased had eaten poison , the allegation of instigating a person to commit suicide against the accused is automatically broken up by the statement of the Discretion Officer .
therefore , in the item of the special nutritious diet it is fair and justified to give Rs 3,000 / - to petitioner .
therefore , the order passed by the prescribed authority / sub-district magistrate Purnagiri , Tanakpur date : 11--7-2008 should be abrogated .
therefore , the order passed by the prescribed authority / sub-district magistrate Purnagiri , Tanakpur date : 11-07-2008 is recoverable and the appeal of appellant is cancellable .

therefore , circulating in the absence of legal forms is not proven .
therefore , using the vested power under the order 14 rule 10 of The Code of Civil Procedure , this request was made by the Court that he is pleased to create an additional point of reference regarding these two facts .
therefore , goods was sealed on the spot by the seal of Shani , it also becomes suspicious by the said event .
therefore , we will please to ensure the security arrangements for maintaining the peaceful situation .
therefore , not being a identification parade does not affect the prosecution evidence .
therefore , the petitioner itself will carry the rest half amount .
therefore , the remaining petitioners no . 1 to 4 and 6 is considered to be dependent of the deceased at the time of the accident .
therefore , there was no reason to do noise and to do attack .
therefore , on the basis of labor , the minimum daily wages rs 100 / - of the deceased is considerable , according to which the monthly salary of deceased is rs 3,000 / - and annual income of deceased is rs 36,000 / - .
therefore , the base taken for the defendant 's defense from the said statement of Mrs Asha Joshi is unbelievable and it is clearly proven to be made with intent to save the accused .
therefore , from the above statement of Mrs. Kalavati Devi PW-3 , this statement of plaintiff 's litigation that my daughter came in the morning , then it was told by her that Maheshram took in sleepiness and beat her up and did bad things with her , as well as the plaintiff 's litigation statement that the accused was taken to police station on date 8 in evening at 8 o 'clock for writing report and that day locked her in police station , the story becomes completely suspected .
therefore , Mrs. Shashi Rani Jaiswal will receive the sum of rs 1,25,000 / - with proportionate interest from the compensation amount and from rest of the amount , the other three petitioner will get equal amount with interest .
therefore , Mrs Sarla Verma and other versus Delhi Transport Corporation and other A.I.R. 2009 pages 3104 , part of the personal expenditure of deceased will be deducted in the light of precedent of honourable Supreme Court .
therefore , Mrs Sarla Verma and other versus Delhi Transport Corporation and other A.I.R. 2009 pages 3104 , part of the personal expenditure of deceased will be deducted in the light of precedent of honourable Supreme Court .
therefore , Mrs. Sarla Verma and other versus Delhi Transport Corporation and other A.I.R. 2009 pages 3104 , part of the personal expenditure of deceased will be deducted in the light of precedent of honourable Supreme Court .
therefore , according to the statement of Mrs. Saraswati Devi PW-2 , the alleged incident has been first seen by Mrs. Saraswati Devi and Mrs. Kamla Devi and on her screaming plaintiff 's lawsuit Mandan Ram , husband of Mrs. Saraswati Devi , who was going to Syoda also came .
so , because of Mrs. Savita Devi 's completely temporarily and contractual working , she is the minor of her son , conclusion can not be abolished to be able to provide nutrition in the original application form .
therefore , Affidavit given by Savita Devi is unbroken on this process , no reasonable forms has been found to believe on this process of unbroken affidavit .
therefore , it is a request to Mr. jee that kindly take a legal action by writing a report of petitioner .
therefore , the concept of due to disappearance of Mr. Dharmanand bhatt son of Mr. Vipin Chandra Bhatt since last 30 years , let the conviction of his demise be declared .
therefore , no inquiry has been done by Hari Singh Rajarwal PW-4 and the entire inquiry has been done by plaintiff 's lawsuit Bachi Singh and on the basis of his explanation , Mr. Hari Singh Rajvar PW-4 , Nayeb Tehsildar forwarded charge sheet against the appellant / accused , which was not legally justified .
therefore , there is no reason to disobey the affidavit .
therefore , no reason is found to disbelieve this testimony of the witness given on the adjuration .
therefore , this fact is proven from the evidence given on the adjuration that the defendant has a nose ring and an ornament of petitioner , petitioner is authorities to get it from defendant .
therefore , the evidence is being suspected of this statement of the prosecution from the testimony of Sharat Singh PW-1 and the witness defendant Shyam Sing and his wife Vimala Devi PW-3
therefore , the evidence of alleged jurisdiction sanctioned has been given during the argument in drunk state , in the light of which this conclusion cannot be taken out that the accused Sovat Singh had actually done a juridical sanction , while by refusing the fact of the juridical sanction , the witness Manbir Singh PW-15 said that Sovat Singh did not say so that we have killed .
therefore , progressive action was taken from the governance level .
therefore , the bonafide requirement is found in the favour of the petitioner / defendant .
therefore , it can not be said beyond doubt that the accused , Krishnakumar , had received a notice of having a voice test .
therefore , this explanation and evidence presented by confidence is suspicious .
therefore , argument of the defendant is that the plaintiff 's party has rogue due to litigation with accused and the plaintiff 's party had illegally occupied the property of accused .
therefore , this argument of defendant is baseless .
therefore , this argument of defendant is not acceptable that the injured party has gone deliberately by the way of Chattar Singh 's house .
therefore , there is enough impact in this argument of defendant that when deceased went to market then there he may have consumed alcohol and fell on the way in returning to home from market and by becoming unconscious and falling over the bushes , he died .
therefore , this argument has been given by the defendant that because of this man is intoxicated , he died after falling on the slope from height and on eating by wild animals , some parts of the body was found missing , his this argument is strong and there is a possibility that the deceased fell himself due to intoxication as the prosecution witness Darshan Singh PW-1 , Beera Devi PW-2 and Puskar Singh PW-3 have accepted this fact that the deceased Jeet Singh used to drink alcohol sometimes , whereas Pushkar Singh PW-3 has made a clear statement that her father used to drink alcohol and I have suspicion on accused of killing my father .
therefore , in discharging his duty by Sabbal Singh and Paimaais Lal Singh Patwari , the litigant was prevented from occupying the government land which is not a crime .
therefore , let the all accused be declared guilty .
therefore , minimum punishment should be given to everyone .
therefore , after considering all the facts and circumstances , in my opinion , it would be justified in all respects to allow the sale of property in question .
therefore , after considering all the facts and circumstances , in my opinion , petition letter is acceptable and the petitioner Mrs. Khurshida as a legal guardian of Siroj , Sahraj , Shanawaaz , Shahnaz and Sameer seems to be justified with this condition that the petitioner will never do any work against the well-being of minors .
therefore , after considering all the facts and circumstances , in my opinion , petition letter is acceptable and apppointing the petitioner Amir Aalam to be the gaurdian for maintenance and management of the body and property of minor Kadim Aalam and Nadim Aalam seems to be justified with this condition that the petitioner will never do any work against the well-being of minors .
therefore , after considering all the facts and circumstances , in my opinion , it would be justified in all respects by permitting the land for sell to the Goverment Institute .
therefore , considering all the facts , this tribunal finds it appropriate to put a co-ordination of 15 for determining compensation in current cases .
therefore , keeping all the facts in view , it would be justified to be given rs 50,000-50,000 / - in respect of death of the three deceased .
therefore , keeping all the circumstances in mind , in my opinion , giving coefficient of 12 will be appropriate in every aspects and thus , by multiplying 12 to Rs.33,600 / - , the amount of compensation becomes 4,03,200 / - four lakh three thousand two hundred .
therefore , keeping all the circumstances in mind , in my opinion , it would be justified to put a benchmark of 17 for the colligation of annual income in the presented case , on applying which the total loss of 17,10,000 / - turns out .
therefore , keeping all the circumstances in mind , in my opinion , it would be justified to put a benchmark of 17 for the colligation of annual income in the presented case , on applying which the total loss of 11,00,000 / - turns out .

therefore , all the five lawsuits are being decided at one time .

therefore , all come under the category of deceased 's dependants
therefore , all come under the category of deceased 's dependants .
therefore , all the petitioners come under the category of the deceased 's dependants .
therefore , considering the time and the nature of crime , if the appellants / the accusers are punished with the period spent by them in judicial custody and the penalty then from it desire of justice is found to be fulfilled .
therefore , this error occurred in relation to date in this interval of time is insignificant and natural , whereas the evidence of police party and defendant going to Delhi in search of NAMAJAD accused is completely liable from the evidences of witnesses .
0
therefore , all the investigations have got corrupt .
therefore , all the proceedings have been done by the Sub-Divisional Officer Lohaghat against the law .
therefore , let all the amount be deposited in the name of minor Kumari Sita .
therefore , keeping all the circumstances in view , the colligation of ' 15 ' is demarcated in this case .
therefore , keeping all the circumstances in view , the income of the deceased is justified to be fixed the amount of rupees 36,000 / - annually on the basis of National Standard .
therefore , keeping all the circumstances in view , the colligation of 10 is demarcated in this case .

therefore , the Petioner number-1 Atik Ahamad , father of the deceased and the petioner number-2 Mrs. Munni , mother of the deceased will be entitled to get the total amount of the compensation .
therefore , the committee would like to approve the selection of Mrs.Chitra wife of Mr. Manohar Negi .

therefore , the total amount of compensation will be collected from the opposition Insurance Company .
therefore , please pass the order to be judged by registering the law report to the concerned police station .
hence , on the basis of possibilities , it will not be called proper and consistent to punish the accused Kishan Ram and Kushal Ram for the charged crime and in that case , prosecution is not successful in proving and certifying the alleged crime against the accused Kishan Ram and Kushal Ram , so the accused Kishan Ram and Kushal Ram is entitled to get free from the alleged crime and no other option besides this is available in front of the court .
therefore , according to the provision given in Sarla Verma etc . , the deceased spent 1 / 5 of the annual income Rs . thirty thousand for himself and he spends the rest amount on his family , so , annual dependent income is made upto Rs 25,000 / - which he spends on his family .
therefore , it is clear to make the consent letter on police station .
therefore , adopting the sympathy and the human vision , after the accident ,
therefore , for convenience , all the miscellaneous dispute are being settled simultaneously .
therefore , the statements of witnesses Atra Devi PW-3 and Purna Devi PW-4 are incredibly admissible because with respect to the presence of these witnesses at the events and incident site , the defendant has done enough cross-examination but there is no doubt that the witness was present on the spot and
therefore , according to witness , child was born alive and he died of suffocation .
therefore , on the basis of being family or a relative , his testimony cannot be considered unreliable , unless there is a serious contradiction .
therefore , this fact is proven from the evidence of witness , panchanama and postmortem report that the death of the deceased Avatar Singh was not a natural death .
hence , the statement of prosecution is not found to be acceptable from the alleged evidence of witness Bharat Singh PW-7 that the witness Bharat Singh saw the deceased only along with the accused Bhagwan Singh because according to the testimony of the witness Bharat Singh himself , this witness has seen the deceased last time with accused Bhagwan Singh and his neighbour Sattar Singh and Mor singh in the house of accused Bhagwan Singh and when this witness came back from the building of Bhagwan Singh even then Sattar Singh and Mor Singh sat in the building of the accused Bhagwan Singh .
therefore , in this regard the statement of the witness Man Singh PW-5 is reliable that he has lodged the report of the incident almost after nineteen hours of the incident near the Patwari Police Station Lalthpatto . therefore , there is no delay in reporting .
therefore , the evidence given by the witness Rajpal Singh PW-2 is found completely reliable , as a result on date : 31.08.08 in evening , the fact of seeing the accused and Bishan Singh together and at that time Bishan Singh being in injured condition on the back of the accused is found to be proven .
therefore , no reason to disbelief on the unbroken evidence of witness Rajendra Singh Hyaanki PW-1 is found on the letter card , whereas the accused has accepted the evidences of this witness in his statement under the examination of section 313 code of criminal procedure .
therefore , this fact is proven by the evidences of the witness Shankar Singh PW-2 that the vehicle was driven rapidly and negligently by Sundar Singh Rana , the owner and driver of vehicle no . U.A.7.R-8623 on the date 20.07.07 , due to which
therefore , this testimony of the witness Shrimati Shanti PW-1 is not convinced from the testimony of the witness Sanjay PW-2 that in front of the witness Sanjay , the deceased told the witness Shanti Singh about the matter to burn the injured by the accused .
therefore , this is evident from the above statement of witness Harish Singh Karki that this witness keeps rogue from the accused and on that basis , he is giving his statement .
